1.  Install the python scripts in a directory such as
    /var/django-projects/surfaceadaptor.

2.  In /var/django-projects/surfaceadaptor create a symbolic link to the
    django project tdsurface.
    sudo ln -s /var/django-projects/tdsurface

3.  Create a symbolic link from /usr/sbin/surfaceadaptor to server.py.
    sudo ln -s /var/django-projects/surfaceadaptor/server.py /usr/sbin/surfaceadaptor

4.  Copy init.d/surfaceadaptor to /etc/init.d/ and make sure it has
    execute privileges.

5.  Create run level links to the init.d script.
